                <h1>Undertow</h1>
                <p>The undertow is a Starbuck recipe, because Starbucks is known for being so masterful with there recipes (queue the picture of a Pink drink).
                    However, the method of making said drink is by pouring a half-inch of sweetened milk (your choice of syrup) and carefully pouring a single shot of espresso
                    over a spoon into the cup. 
                    Doing so creates a mixture that has the shot sitting carefully on top of the milk. 
                    If you were to run your hand along the cup, you'd be able to feel the coldness of the milk, 
                    and the heat of the shot on top.

                As I tasted the drink, my immediate thoughts were that the coffee was extremely bitter.
                I am a barista, but I definitely don't like drinking espresso without it mixed.                
                
                Personally, this "secret menu" item isn't really my style. One, it isn't taught how to make said
                drink, so when customers order this item, it really throws Baristas off. Two, 
                its just an upside cortado (again I'm hinting at Starbucks' masterful craft of coffee).

                However, when the drink is thoroughly mixed together with the syrups of your choice,
                it makes for a good little coffee to get you going.

                <h1>Cortado</h1>
                <p>I just recently came across a Cortado. I definitely didn't know how to make
                    the drink that the customer was asking for. However, a cortado is a single 
                    ounce of milk with a single ounce of espresso. You can ask for sweetner in this drink,
                    but it is best to drink it without for the best flavor.

                Like the undertow, this drink can serve a great purpose of being cheap and quick for a jump in the day. 
                Personally, I loved the taste of this coffee. It's a unique and bold flavor. It tastes like a strong latte.
